    <h1>About WebPageTest</h1>
    <div class="box">
        <p>Building high quality web experiences for users is at the core of all our efforts. With WebPageTest,
            we strive to provide performance products and resources to our global and growing community of developers,
            third-party platforms, technical consultants and others. WebPage as a tool was originally developed by
            Patrick Meenan while he was at AOL for use internally and was open-sourced in 2008 under a BSD license.
            The online version at <a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/">www.webpagetest.org</a> is run for the benefit
            of the performance community.</p>

        <p>WebPageTest was acquired in September of 2020 by <a href="https://www.catchpoint.com/">Catchpoint</a>, the leading Digital Experience Monitoring
            platform providing <a href="https://www.catchpoint.com/guide-to-synthetic-monitoring">Synthetic Monitoring</a>, Real User Measurement, Network Monitoring, and Endpoint Monitoring products.</p>

        <p>The acquisition starts a new and exciting chapter as we plan to expand WebPageTest's capabilities and WebPageTest.org's
            geographical performance testing footprint, leveraging Catchpoint's best-in-class infrastructure, adding capacity and
            improving consistency and quality of analytics. You can read more about Catchpoint's acquisition of
            WebPageTest <a href="https://www.catchpoint.com/webpagetest-joins-catchpoint">here</a>.

            long as you are not creating a product or service that competes with Catchpoint's offerings then you
            are free to do whatever you like with the WebPageTest code, including using it for your own internal
            use or creating non-competing commercial products from it. In fact, we encourage using the WebPageTest
            code to build your own value-added applications. Read
